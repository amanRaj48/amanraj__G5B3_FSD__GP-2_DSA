Problem Statement:
1.) 
Your friend is a chief architect, who is working on building a skyscraper, in Mumbai. 
The construction is in such a way that the floors will be constructed in other factories
and they will be assembled. All the sizes will be distinct.

The skyscraper needs to be constructed in N days with the following conditions :

a)	Every day a floor is constructed in a separate factory of distinct size.
b)	The floor with the larger size must be placed at the bottom of the building.
c)	The floor with the smaller size must be placed at the top of the building.

Note: A floor cannot be assembled in the building until all floors larger in size are placed.
As a friend he wants you to build a small program that will help him analyze the construction process, to avoid manual work and errors.

Input:
First Line: contains the total floors N in the building
Second Line onwards: Contains N inputs in which the ith integer denotes the size of the floor that will be given to architect by factories on the ith day.


Output:
You are required to print N lines. Print the size of the floor in descending order, which can be assembled.
If no floor can be assembled on the ith day, leave the line empty.


2.)
You are working in an MNC, which manages the Transactions, 
where only BST is used as a Data Structure.
The company stores all the data of transactions in BST such that the tree is always a complete BST.

A new business requirement has arrived where the BST should not contain any left node.
You are required to modify the existing BST and display the node values present in ascending order.
